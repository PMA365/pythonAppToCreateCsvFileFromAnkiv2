," The Newspaper UmbrellaOur neighbor is an affluent inventor whose latest brainstorm, a feasible umbrella substitute, has been featured in many magazines. As simply as the eye can discern, it is a hard plastic strip, about the size of a ruler, which fits comfortably into a woman's handbag or a man's suit jacket. If a person is caught in a sudden rainstorm, he swings the plastic open in the shape of a cross. Attached to each arm is a clip-like device. Next, he takes the newspaper he is carrying and slides it under each of the four clips. Now, equipped with a rigid head covering he can sally forth to face the elements. To the consternation of the umbrella manufacturers, it has been enjoying a brisk sale, especially among commuters. If it continues to do well, it could have a pernicious* effect upon the umbrella industry. element●(هر یک از چهار عنصرآب، آتش، هوا و خاک به عنوان زیستگاه هر موجود) محیط طبیعیwater is the element of fishes and air is that of birdsآب محیط طبیعی ماهیان و هوا محیط طبیعی پرندگان است.feature●(به طور چشمگیر) نمایش دادن، برجسته کردن (مطلب یا نمایش)، (جنبه‌های چیزی را) نشان دادن، فروزه‌نمایی کردنthis movie features our town's historyاین فیلم (جنبه‌های مهم) تاریخ ما را نشان می‌دهد.●(در آگهی‌ها یا نمایش‌ها یا روزنامه یا سینما و غیره) برنامه‌ی اصلی، مقاله‌ی اصلی، سرمقاله، تصویر اصلی، فیلم اصلی، فیلم بلندtonight's feature presentation is ...برنامه‌ی اصلی امشب عبارت است از ....she wrote a feature article about the homelessاو یک مقاله‌ی بلند درباره‌ی بی‌خانمان‌ها نوشت.when does the feature begin?فیلم اصلی کی شروع می‌شود؟enjoyبرخوردارشدن از ،بهره مند شدن feature●(به طور چشمگیر) نمایش دادن، برجسته کردن (مطلب یا نمایش)، (جنبه‌های چیزی را) نشان دادن، فروزه‌نمایی کردنthis movie features our town's historyاین فیلم (جنبه‌های مهم) تاریخ ما را نشان می‌دهد.●(در آگهی‌ها یا نمایش‌ها یا روزنامه یا سینما و غیره) برنامه‌ی اصلی، مقاله‌ی اصلی، سرمقاله، تصویر اصلی، فیلم اصلی، فیلم بلندtonight's feature presentation is ...برنامه‌ی اصلی امشب عبارت است از ....she wrote a feature article about the homelessاو یک مقاله‌ی بلند درباره‌ی بی‌خانمان‌ها نوشت.when does the feature begin?فیلم اصلی کی شروع می‌شود؟_________________________________________element/el´ǝ mǝnt/n.●(هر یک از چهار عنصر آب، آتش، هوا و خاک که در قدیم همه‌ی اجسام را متشکل از آن می‌دانستند) آخشیجthe four elementsچهار آخشیج، عناصر اربعه، آخشیگان●(هر یک از این چهار عنصر به عنوان زیستگاه هر موجود) محیط طبیعیwater is the element of fishes and air is that of birdsآب محیط طبیعی ماهیان و هوا محیط طبیعی پرندگان است.●محیط مناسب (بیشتر به صورت: in (or out) of one's element)، محیط دلخواهwhen I am in a library I really feel I am in my elementهنگامی که در یک کتابخانه هستم مثل این است که دنیا را به من داده‌اند.she felt totally out of her elementاو احساس می‌کرد که اصلا با آن محیط مناسبت ندارد."

," Much Ado About a HaircutPerhaps you read about our school in the newspapers? We were one of the first to have a showdown on the topic of long hair for boys. Two honor students, Ron Harris and Len Chester, were sent to the principal by their French teacher, an implacable foe of nonconformists, who went into a paroxysm of anger when she spied the boys in the hall. At first it seemed like a simple case. The school would reprimand* the boys for their reprehensible appearance and order them to cut their hair or be suspended. But the boys' parents decided that the school had overstepped its jurisdiction; they took their case to the newspapers. What had started as a local skirmish now began to take on the appearance of a full-scale war. ado/ǝ dōō´/n.●هیاهو، قیل و قال، بیا و برو، هیجان، شر و شور، جنجالmuch ado about nothingهیاهوی بسیار برای هیچ* without further ado● بدون درد سر بیشتر، بدون بگو مگوی دیگر"

," Dooley's MissionAboard the refugee ship, Dooley's destiny took shape. He became painfully cognizant* of the malnutrition, disease, ignorance, and fear that afflicted the natives. In addition, he discerned* how active the Communists had been in spreading their anti-American propaganda. Tom Dooley pitched in to build shelters in Haiphong, and to comfort the poor Vietnamese there before that besieged city fell to the powerful Viet Minh forces. He was seemingly unconcerned by the many privations he had to endure. For his services, Dooley received the U.S. Navy's Legion of Merit. He told the story of this exciting experience in Deliver Us from Evil, a best seller that alerted America to the plight of the Vietnamese as well as to the sinister menace of communism. pitch inpitch inphrasal verbINFORMALto start to do something as part of a group, especially something helpful:● (عامیانه) 1- با حرارت آغاز به کار کردن 2- همکاری کردن، سهیم شدن در کارIf we all pitch in together, it shouldn't take too long.aboard- adv,- prepon a ship or vehicleتوى ، از روى ، داخل (کشتى يا هواپيما) ـ{علوم دريايى}:روى کشتىignoranceنادانی، جهلshelter/shel´tǝr/n., vt., vi.●پناهگاه، سرپناه،an air raid shelterپناهگاه حمله‌ی هواییplight(1)/plīt/noun.●گرفتاری، مخمصه، فلاکت، بدبختی، بلیه، وضع بدthe plight of the homelessبدبختی بی‌خانمان‌ها pitch in● (عامیانه) 1- با حرارت آغاز به کار کردن 2- همکاری کردن، سهیم شدن در کاربا سعى و جديت شروع به کار کردن ، شروع به خوردن غذا کردنplight(1)/plīt/noun.●گرفتاری، مخمصه، فلاکت، بدبختی، بلیه، وضع بدthe plight of the homelessبدبختی بی‌خانمان‌هاshelter/shel´tǝr/n., vt., vi.●پناهگاه، سرپناه،an air raid shelterپناهگاه حمله‌ی هواییthe trees offered good shade and shelterدرختان سایه و سرپناه خوبی بودند.a shelter for the homelessپناهگاه بی‌خانمان‌ها pitch inpitch inphrasal verbINFORMALto start to do something as part of a group, especially something helpful:If we all pitch in together, it shouldn't take too long.When I bought this house, all my friends pitched in to help fix it up.My brother pitched inwithan offer of transport.After we had seen the video everyone started pitching inwithcomments on its faults.plightplight(CONDITION)/plaɪt/nounan unpleasant condition, especially a serious, sad or difficult one:theplightofthe poor/homelessFew of us can be unmoved by the plight of the Romanian orphans. pitch inphrasal verbinformalto join others and help with an activity:If we all pitch in, it won't take very long to finish.plight/plaɪt/nouna bad, serious, or sad situation that someone is in:theplight ofwomen in that societythe university's financial plight aboard- adv,- prepon a ship or vehicleThe passengers went aboard the ‘Queen Elizabeth’ at 10 p.m.When the ship docked, customs officers came aboard to inspect the cargo.plight- nouna bad situation or condition (dated.)You must pity the plight of the people made homeless by the war."
